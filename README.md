[PARI's](https://ruralindiaonline.org/categories/faces/) facial map of India,
on a map.

## Overview

The project aims to give a different view to the beautiful faces of India from
the People's Archive of Rural India's faces project.  The project aims to
collect 3 photographs of people from each
district.

PARI describes their Faces page using the phrase "facial map of India".  This
inspired me to try and put these faces on a map.

This project is also an attempt by me to learn Clojure and Clojurescript.  It
is very much a work in progress, and any code improvements are more than
appreciated.
